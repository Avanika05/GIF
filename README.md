# GIF 
This is a simple Python script to convert images into a GIF using the `imageio` library.

## How it works
- Reads multiple `.jpg` images of the same size (other extensions like 'jpeg','png',etc. work too)
- Exports a `.gif` using `imageio.imwrite()`

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install imageio
